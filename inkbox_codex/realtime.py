"""Inkbox ↔ OpenAI Realtime API voice bridge for live phone calls.

Ported from the reference Inkbox realtime bridge, with the coding-agent tool
tier kept intact.

When Realtime is configured, the gateway pre-opens an OpenAI Realtime
WebSocket *before* accepting the Inkbox call in raw-media mode, then runs
two pumps for the call's duration:

* caller audio (Inkbox ``media`` frames, base64 μ-law) → OpenAI
  ``input_audio_buffer.append``; server-side VAD handles turn-taking.
* OpenAI ``response.output_audio.delta`` → Inkbox ``media`` frames, so the
  model's own voice is what the caller hears.

The Realtime model runs the spoken conversation itself. It only reaches
back to Codex through the ``consult_agent`` tool — and only when the caller
asks for real work or account/contact context. The consult runs in the caller's
shared :class:`~inkbox_codex.sessions.ContactSession` and its text answer
is handed back to the model, which speaks it. If OpenAI can't be reached
the gateway falls back to Inkbox STT/TTS (see ``_handle_call_ws``).
